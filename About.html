            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Filipino martial are called by different names depending on the region of the Phillipines, generally it is called Arnis in the North, Eskrima in the middle, and Kali in the South.</p>
            <h3>Arnis: The National Sport of the Phillippines</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick fighting ('Arnis') is the national sport of the Phillipines. Contestants wear armour and a head guard and fight full contact with sticks made from rattan. Other forms of competition include padded  fighting in which a padded stick is utilised instead of rattan, combatants usually only wear headguards for these matches.</p>

            <h1>The different facets of the Filipino Martial Arts</h1>
            <h2>Unarmed Self Defense and Combat - Pangamut</h2>
            <h3>Filipino 'Boxing'</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filipino 'Boxing' also called Panantukan comes from the amalgamation of traditional Filipino martial arts and western boxing (popularised by the American occupation of the Philippines). The term ‘blade boxing’ is also sometimes used to describe it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect of the art utilises punching and bare-fist techniques which are influenced from training with bladed weapons (namely knives). This accounts for some of the uniqueness of the Filipino martial arts hand to hand combat techniques.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kicking is also used within the Filipino martial arts but is usually restricted to targeting the lower half of the body, hence the name Pananjakman or 'low line kicking'. Off balancing, knee strikes, and foot trapping is also used.</p>
            <h3>Dumog - Grappling and Luyong</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filipino martial arts also use grappling techniques such as off balancing, throws/take-downs, and joint manipulation and locking. Dumog is the generalised name often given to Filipino grappling, while Luyong is essentially lock flows - moving from one lock to another dependent on the opponent and the situation.</p>

            <h1>Weapon Combat and Defence</h1>
            <h3>Stick Fighting</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eskrima/Kali/Arnis is probably most widely known for the stick fighting aspect. Stick fighting which originated in the bladed combat techniques utilises rattan canes or other hard wood stick, called ‘olisi’ or ‘baston’ by the Filipino people. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick fighting encompasses striking, blocking, parrying, and also crosses into disarming and grappling techniques. Most Filipino systems have a core series of strikes called ‘Numerada’ or ‘Abecedario’ which form the basis of their system, often these consist of twelve strikes.</p>
            <h3>Knife and Bladed Weapon Defence</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines has long had a blade carrying culture, which has resulted in a very practical knife defence system which is used by security and military forces throughout the world. Tribal warfare involved the use of a number of different bladed weapons including the longer Kampilan, Kris, and Espada swords, medium length blades such as the Barong and ‘Bolo’ machetes, and shorter knives. Baraw is one of the names given to the Filipino knife defence systems.</p>
